    <ol>
      <li>Roles are used by Snowflake to <b>control access to objects</b> within the organization and allow users to perform actions against those objects.
        Users can have several roles granted to them, and can also have a default role assigned. Since a user is allowed to switch roles during a session in
        order to have the appropriate permissions to perform certain actions, the Snowflake app accomodates this by having an optional 'role' parameter
        in each of the actions. If this parameter is left blank, the default role assigned to the user will be used.</li>
